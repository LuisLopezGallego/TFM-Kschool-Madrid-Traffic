# TFM-Kschool-Madrid-Traffic

Readme file of my TFM about the analysis of traffic evolution in Madrid

The repository contains an analysis done about the impact of the Madrid Central restriction on the traffic intensity in the surrounding areas of Madrid Central.

To be able to follow the process properly, you may need to open and run the files in the repository in the following order:

0. Notebook 0 Data Acquisition: Downloading files with the data => notebook containing a script to GoogleDrive to download the files with the data used for the project
1. Notebook 1 Data Cleaning and Preparation (1): Devices Location => notebook with the code to analyse and visualize the location of the traffic measure devices
2. Notebook 2 Data Cleaning and Preparation (2): Traffic Data => notebook with all the code related to the traffic data from January 2015 to April 2019. Actions performed on each file per month to afterwards concatenating them into a final dataframe with the devices
3. Notebook 3 Analysis (1): Time Series => analytical analysis of the forecast before Madrid Central restriction began and real observations performed for each device chosen from the surrounding area
4. Notebook 4 Analysis (2): Time Series => forecasting traffic of the devices
5. Notebook 5 Visualization and Conclusions: charts summarizing the results and conclusions
